  "readme": "# grunt-mailgun\n\n> Send emails though mailgun as part of your build. Created to test our email template builds.\n\nThis is being hastily deployed for internal consumption. You probably shouldn't use this yet.\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-mailgun --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-mailgun');\n```\n\n*This plugin was designed to work with Grunt 0.4.x. If you're still using grunt v0.3.x it's strongly recommended that [you upgrade](http://gruntjs.com/upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4)*\n\n\n## Use case\n\nWe have a build pipeline that compiles jade and sass into inline-styled HTML pages for email msgs.\n\nThe final step is to shoot out tests of each template to make sure nothing looks wonky.\n\n## mailgun task\n_Run this task with the `grunt mailgun` command._\n\nTask targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.\n### Options\n\n#### key\nType: `String`\n\nYour [Mailgun API key](http://documentation.mailgun.com/quickstart.html#authentication)\n\n#### sender\nType: `String`\n\nThe 'from' name and address. Acceptable domains may be restricted by your mailgun account settings\n\n#### recipient\nType: `String` or `Array`\n\nOne or more email addresses to send your msg to. Multiple addresses should be\nentered as an array.\n\n\n#### subject\nType: `String`\n\nThe subject of your email\n\n#### body\nType: `String`\n\nIf no files are specified in `src:`, the mailgun task will send a plaintext email\nusing `body` for the msg content.\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nYou probably shouldn't use this right now, but if you insist...\n\n`src:` is one or more files to be used as an email body. A new email will be sent for each file.\n\n```coffeescript\nmodule.exports = (grunt) ->\n\n  grunt.initConfig\n    mailgun:\n      mailer:\n        options:\n          key: 'your-mailgun-API-key'\n          sender: 'noreply@testsauce.biz'\n          recipient: 'email.you.want.to.send.to@email.com'\n          subject: 'This is a test email'\n        src: ['templates/*.html']\n  \n  grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-mailgun'\n```\n",
